Want to build out a poker game:

Basic Functionality:
- Cards
    - User Cards (2 cards each player)
    - Cards in the middle
    - Rest of deck
- Hierarchy
- 2 Players
- Betting Ammount
- Turns
    - Betting
    - Fold
    - Check


How I Could Go About It:
1. Establish 52 Cards globablly
    - Establish a hierarchy of Cards (I can have suits, but can just use if statements to say that higher better than another)
    - Also a hierarchy of hands (doubles, triples, straight, flush)
    - Randomly distribute 2 to p1 and 2 to p2 without replacement... the rest are in the deck

2. Betting Protocol:
    - Each user should be given a random value of chips between 1000 and 10000
    - 
    -

3. Turns
    - Show users their cards... don't worry about keeping hidden from others ()
